# Modded Minecraft Malware "fractureiser"

## What?
`fractureiser` is a [Worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm) Virus found in several Minecraft projects uploaded to CurseForge and CraftBukkit's dev website. The malware is embedded in multiple mods, some of which were added to highly popular modpacks.

If left unchecked, fractureiser can be **INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS** to your machine. Please read through this document for the info you need to keep yourself safe.

We've dubbed this malware `fractureiser` because that's the name of the CurseForge account that uploaded the most notable malicious files.  
*Pardon our dust*, this is a living document being edited by multiple people about a developing situation. Some sections may be messy.

## Current Investigation status
We have a good idea how fractureiser works, from stages 0 to 3. There are certain unknowns, but stage 0 bootstrapping was quickly nipped and tomorrow we'll be moving our focus to mitigation. As a plan, we've contacted Mojang and will likely be working with teams to get detection software distributed and integrated into CurseForge and Modrinth, as well as considering integration in launchers like Prism, and mod loaders like Fabric and Forge. It is also worthwhile to run this detection software on mod distribution mavens, as it's possible some have become infected.

Most of the current team responsible for updating this doc is tired and going to bed (as of 02:46a Pacific time). Others are continuing to reverse engineer stage 3.

Work has begun on a detector for infected stage0 mods: https://github.com/MCRcortex/nekodetector
